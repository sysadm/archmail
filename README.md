## About Archmail

Archmail is a small software to archive your IMAP mailbox. It was created for internal purpose
of [Multitel A.S.B.L.](http://www.multitel.be/) (non-profit organisation) by Jerzy SÅ‚adkowski to have IMAP mailbox backup,
absolutely independent from any servers. Idea was to create a folder with html files (each email
in a separate html) and attachments. In addition, it should have been created html indexes to have
ordered in specific way lists of emails (threaded, date, subject, author or emails with attachments only).
Folder with that backup can be burn, for example on DVD. And for access to your mail archive you have to use
browser only, nothing else. All modern browser must be supported. That was a main idea.

The author was inspired by the [hypermail](http://www.hypermail-project.org/). Well, hypermail
can create mailists, but only from unix mbox, can't use IMAP with multiple folders that can also be nested.

Archmail is compatible with [Gmail](https://www.gmail.com/). Gmail also offer the backup of your mails, for example
[first](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/gmail,calendar) or
[second](https://code.google.com/p/gmail-backup-com/) solution, but like an
unix mailbox of specific folder(label) in your mailbox. Even third party solution, like [Gmvault](http://gmvault.org/) have the
same approach and the same problem. That programs just generate typical "backup". You can save everything and restore it
on server (eventually open in specific mailer program). Archmail instead of typical backup create full-featured offline
"mailer program". You can find and access any email in any folder really fast, easy and in many different ways.

During the work somehow came out that was quite an interesting application that generate html visually pleasing.
At least, so it seems for the author :)
