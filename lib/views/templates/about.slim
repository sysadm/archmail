      'Archmail is a small software to archive your imap mailbox. It was created for internal purpose of
      a href="http://www.multitel.be/" target="_blank" Multitel A.S.B.L.
      '  (non-profit organisation) by Jerzy SÅ‚adkowski to have imap mailbox backup, absolutely independent from any servers.
      The idea was to create a folder with html files (each email in a separate html) and attachments.
      '  In addition, it should have been created html indexes to have ordered in specific way lists of emails (threaded,
      by date, subject, author or only with attachments). Folder with that backup can be burn, for example on DVD.
      '  And for access to your backup you have to use browser only. That was a main idea.

      'The author was inspired by the
      a href="http://www.hypermail-project.org/" target="_blank" hypermail
      '. Ok, hypermail can create mailists, but only from unix mbox,
      it can't use IMAP with multiple folders that can also be nested.
    p During the work somehow came out that was quite an interesting application that generate html visually pleasing.
      At least, so it seems for the author :)
    p Since this is a completely free software under GPL license - feel free to contribute, improve its source code or give me
      constructive criticism. Your git pull request will be pleasantly welcome.
    p Thanks a lot for using!
